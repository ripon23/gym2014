$lang['website_overview'] = 'Bangladesh is an agricultural based country. A large percentage of  rural people depend on agriculture or agriculture related jobs. Seasonal crops of different types are cultivated in Bangladesh. All  crops are used for meeting  the demand of the local people. So, export of local crops in a foreign country is a big challenge. There is ample land for production of profitable crops in Bangladesh. Due to lack of knowledge about profitable crops, the people of rural area cannot utilize their land. Mung bean is a crop which is used in our country as pulse but in Japan it is used as vegetables (bean sprout). Bean sprout is a popular vegetable in Japan. Japan is dependent on imports primarily from China for nearly 100 percent of the mung beans it consumes. So, the farmers of Bangladesh have a good opportunity to gain  more income through mung bean cultivation. Grameen Yukiguni Miatake Ltd. is giving support for the cultivation of mung bean in the farmers land. Grameen Yukiguni Maitake Ltd. is giving knowledge about modern ways of mung bean cultivation.';
